# spaCy Symspell
## Spelling correction implementation in spaCy via Symspell

This package is a [spaCy 2.0 extension](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines#section-extensions) that adds sentnece/spelling corrections via Symspell to spaCy's text processing pipeline.

## Installation

`pip install spacy_symspell`

## Notes
This package is still in Alpha and there may be unforeseen errors. Performance improvement still needs to be done for the symspell python port.

## Usage

Adding the component to the processing pipeline is relatively simple:

```
import spacy
from spacy_symspell import SpellingCorrector

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
corrector = SpellingCorrector()
nlp.add_pipe(corrector)
doc = nlp('What doyuoknowabout antyhing')

doc._.suggestions  #iterable[0] - What doyon about anything
doc._.segmentation  #::segmented_string - What doyouk now about antyhing ::corrected_string - that dook now about anything
```

spaCy_symspell operates on `Doc` and `Span` spaCy objects. When called on a `Doc` or `Span`, the object is given two attributes: `suggestions` (a list of all found spelling suggestions) and `segmentation` (a corrected sentence in the case of ommitted spaces).

## Todo
Symspell accuracy can be improved with the help of spaCy by extracting and analyzing resulting n-grams and cross-referencing with possible n-grams deductible from the character groups in the symspell result. For example the correction 'that dook now' leaves us with a verbless sentence, and on closer analysis will reveal that the character group 'now' is related with the verb 'know', and the verb know is associated with the n-gram 'you know'.

## Under the hood
spacy_symspell is currently a wrapper of the [python port](https://github.com/mammothb/symspellpy) for [Symspell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell). For additional details, see the linked project pages.
